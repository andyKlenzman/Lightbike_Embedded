Build type: Debug
-- Found my Python interpreter: /opt/homebrew/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11
fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'
Auto sign and upload marked as TRUE. CMAKE is uploading a binary file to Jsegger, so it can be flashed onto our processor

CMAKE SYNTAX LESSON: ALL means it is built by default, DEPENDS means it depends on the following things to be built first
-- Configuring done (0.1s)
-- Generating done (0.0s)
