# Lightbike

Lightbike enhances bicycle visibility and aesthetics through motion-responsive LED patterns. The system employs a ICM20649 accelerometer and gyroscope and an EFR32MG24 MCU mounted on both of a bike axises, with connect WS2812b LEDs wound through the spokes. Motion data is collected via the ICM20649 sensor, and LEDs are driven by using SPI. There are two buttons to power off the device and switch through various filter modes.
