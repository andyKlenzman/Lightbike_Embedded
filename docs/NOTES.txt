- Got the basic functionality up and runnning.

The next step is to build out the basic layer that will allow me to make extensible functionality


It makes sense only to build with the accelerometer and LEDs, since the gyroscope functionalyitz will be similar
and will only add complexity in the meantime.

if I build out the git repo adn get feedback from people, can work and using an interface that makes sense.

becomes a cmake project as well, because I can figure out how to build out these bundles.


GOAL: every day give the boring stuff due time before getting into the coding.
Next week, do the most boring things first.
- GH repo
- CMAKE changes
- error handeling
- anything else on the code review list

Outside of that: priority is to get the VISA in, begin GH project for people adding changes to the repo.

Structure of the extensible architecture
- Have global variables each LED filter can use to interact with
- Each LED filter can have infinite complexity, but always inputs and outputs some sort of
transformation to a frame of LEDs . could include rate change, last frame of LEDS, maybe it contains the last value,
so if they want it can build off the last one.
    - depending on greatest direction of acceleration, one color gets higher or the other lower, with a smooth controlled train rate

These can have filter groups, which can be combined and overlapped
This is paired with an abstraction layer, to allow experimentation with user interfaces, if a button press or something otherwise will change it.
